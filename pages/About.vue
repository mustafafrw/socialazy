      We are two young entreprenuers who have developed our own website. The website is about comments posted on youtube channels, so the main idea is;<br><br>

      1. You can see the top liked youtube comments on your youtube channel which will help you develop your content in line with the most supported comments.<br>
      2. You can have a general overview about your subscribers’ comments which will lead you to see the big cake.<br>
      3. Since youtube has become very competitve, you can see the top comments of other youtube channels as well. Just to underscore that you will not see a video’s top comments but the entire channel’s.<br>
      4. You can view the entire comments of a certain subscriber has made on youtube which will enable you to deeply understand what your top subscribers are fond of.<br>

      Firstly we more than welcome any idea that you want us to develop. We strongly believe that the website is worth to take a visit. To see the best comments in your videos and to make more content about it, go to socialazy.com<br>
      <br>
      Enjoy your journey on our website!<br>
